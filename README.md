# MillerTime

In the movie **Interstellar** there's a planet called the Miller's Planet, 
in that planet the times goes different, 
1 hour in the Miller's Planet is 7 years.

So there is a function made in python thath when you introduce a date, yo can watch how many seconds
have passed in the Miller's Planet, how many minutes and how many seconds.


Sorry if I made any mistake, I'm not very good in english.
